# WaveDAC App
This is a Kivy GUI that can be used to test the functionality of the PySerial package
coupled to Kivy. It is a GUI that requires a firmware running on a MCU (e.g., a CY8CKIT-059) 
that sends data with appropriate packets and handles the commands sent from the GUI.

## Software Requirements
- Kivy
- PySerial
